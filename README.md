sysview-html5
=============

Intended as an upgrade to the [original](https://github.com/DHTC-Tools/htcondor-sysview) sysview, this uses HTML5's canvas to render the mosaic.

Unlike the original, though, this sysview does not function as a standalone - it relies on a JSON feed of node data being provided.
