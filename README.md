sysview-html5
=============

Intended as an upgrade to the [original](https://github.com/DHTC-Tools/htcondor-sysview) sysview, this uses HTML5's canvas to render the mosaic.

The `mosaic.html` file pulls a json feed that is generated by the `generate_mosaic_json.py` script in order to render the mosaic.
